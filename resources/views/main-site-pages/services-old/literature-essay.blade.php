<p>A <b>literature extended essay</b>  requires sharpened writing,comprehensives expression of thought as well as study.Much of the writing is developed on skills of writing, enhanced perception as well as critical and analytical abilities. The outcome of the writing is a development of a new idea or perspective against the topic under analysis.

The statement is a specifically worded declarative sentence which discloses the purpose of the essay. The purpose might also be the writer’s point of view on the topic.
