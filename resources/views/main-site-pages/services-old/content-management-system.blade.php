						Content Management System is an electronic system which enables editing, publishing and modifying content in addition to the website from a central page itself. It offers a collection of computer-based and manual procedures to direct the flow of work in a mutual environment. Content Management System pulls out a website from its shelf-life which is somewhere between three to four years. CMS allows the owner of the site to change to templates of the website from time to time that can improve the website visibility on the search engines and avoid absolute overhaul which can drain the resources available.

						CMS website can be reformatted entirely simply by applying a new design to its template. CMS, on the other hand, allows implementation of extranets, the addition of new sections and protect the website from losing it’s virtual presence.

							<h4>Advantages of CMS over normal websites</h4>

							<p>
								A normal website is nothing but a brochure which is used to sell products and services online or to expand the business further through resulting exposure. Normal websites are designed, built and hosted by a website designer and programmed using XHMTL or HTML coding or language. And if by chance any changes are needed on the online website the web designer or a technician will have to fully delete or create an entirely new web page.
							</p>
							<p>
								On the other hand, a CMS website makes sure that the contents of the website can be updated, edited and frequently deleted through ACCESS database, MSSQL or MySQL using server oriented coding and languages like ASP.net, ASP or PHP.
