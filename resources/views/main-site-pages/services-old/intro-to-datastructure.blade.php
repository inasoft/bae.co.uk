						<p>A data structure is a process of arranging the important data on a computer so that data can be efficiently used when it is needed. Different types of data structure suit the different kinds of applications. The data structure is very useful as it offers different means to efficiently manage a large amount of data such as an enormous amount of database of an Internet indexing service. The stack is a great example of the data structure which is used for storing temporary data.

							In other words, management is all about managing different tasks and activities at once. Looking at the business perspective front, it is the management skill of a person that brings together the efforts of staff and workers to accomplish the goal of the company or business by efficiently using resources available. Doing business management is essential if you are planning to run a successful business in a long run as the branch teaches a profitable way of communicating with the targeted market using a language of the business.
