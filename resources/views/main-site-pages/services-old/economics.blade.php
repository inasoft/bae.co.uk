						<p>Economics may appear to be a study of complicated tables and charts, statistics and numbers but most specifically it is considered to be a study of human behaviour as a relationship between end and scarce means which have alternative uses. 
						</p>
						<p>
							On the other way, economics is how society manages its scarce recourses. Hence, the branch of economics is so vast it confuses people. 
						</p>
						<p>
							As an individual, for example, you may face problems of having limited recourses with which to fulfil your wants and needs. As a result, you may make certain choices with money. You probably spent a part of your money on food, electricity, water or rent. Then you might use the rest to watch a movie or buy a pair of jeans. Economists are interested in the choices you make and inquire into why for you want to make such decisions. Economics is thus a social science which examines people behaving according to their self-interests.
