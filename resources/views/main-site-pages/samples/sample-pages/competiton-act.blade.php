						<p class="fs-18"><strong>Question 1. (b) Comment on the extent to which the competition law compliance strategy reflects and promotes legal literacy and awareness throughout the organization
                        </strong></p>
						
						<p>Encouragement for the continuous competition should be done by implementing the application of the relevant regulation that does not involve into discrimination in favor of or in against of the business of an individual or a group of business. Competition law usually works well in respect to promote healthy competition that make a company grow and expand itself with respect to other company (Corones, 2007). This supports the healthy completion and not preventing or restricting business from the competition. The current competition law work efficiently and effectively in order to promote competitive markets (Griggs et al., 2012). The competitive law promotes competition in the increasing global market in respect to the change in the market and the social structure and also in respect to the technological change. Therefore, in this respect, Wesfarmers’s response is inclined and supportive to the competition law and making the organization well aware of the current competition and legal literacy. 
  
						</p>


						
						<p>Remaining import protection should be removed and governments should restrict from any new policies that are responsible for the increase in protection of the competition. The priorities for a competition law reform agenda for ensuring that efficient businesses, large or small, can compete effectively and drive growth in productivity and living standards (Miller and Miller, 2013). The company’s most agenda in respect to the competitive law for generating awareness including criteria like all the meeting must have a specific and effective demonstrative purpose and meeting must be recorded, presentation of legal counsel during all the board meetings and members attending meeting must be aware of the antitrust compliance guideline.

						</p>


						<p>Furthermore, it must be adhered to the company in this case that there are diverse consequences of in case any non compliance; in includes: (Paterson, 2012)
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Damages for the compensation of the other party

							</li>
							<li>
								Variation in the existing contracts

							</li>
							<li>
								Corrective advertisements, and 
							</li>
							<li>
								Refunds
							</li>

						</ul>
						<p>
							In certain cases, it can bring damages to the reputation of the company.

                        <p class="fs-18"><strong>Question 1. (C)Recommendation for company’s management activity in respect to the competition law compliance

                        </strong></p>
                        <p>
                        	The primary priority that is considered by Wesfarmers of any kind of competition policy reform agenda should be involved of ensuring continuous promotion of competition. It actually encourages the continuous promotion and not the prevention and protection of the companies and businesses from competition. Although, the competitive law compliance of Wesfarmers is an inclusion of the company’s policies regarding the meeting that are held in respect to the demonstration of the company’s policies and awareness and legal literacy. The company has its aim in respect to its achievement, growth and prosperity. Its principle aims include satisfying consumers by providing them goods and relevant services on the basis of competition and professionalism (Ciro et al., 2014). For this, the company needs to make their competitive level higher with comparison to the other companies in this segment and alongside by not regarding the quality of the product and the services they provide. It aims at providing the shareholders with a satisfactory return and the business operation should be transparent and the financial records and the performance should be continually update in the business magazines. Acting with honesty integrity is one of the basic aims of the company. Principle of competition law 'is the based upon the promotion and protection of competitive processes and behavior for the interest and benefit of consumers that can be enhanced by maintaining the transparency in their business, maintain the quality of the product and services and ensuring availability of the product at the reasonable price in accordance to the price of the other company in the similar sector (Pearson, 2009).  The completion compliance encourages continuous competition and not the protection from competition (Bruce, 2013). For that the company adheres to the rules policy of the business organization in order to remain competitive in the business environment should emphasize upon catering to the specific need of the customers with the help of good quality products and services. Moreover, in the competitive business environment, competing on the basis of product and service qualities is not enough, thus in this context, they need to acquire the most efficient talent pool who would lead the organization towards successful accomplishment of their goals and objectives.

                        <p class="fs-18"><strong>Question 2. Role of Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in relation with Case Study
                        </strong></p>
                        <p>
                        	As per Australian Consumer Law it is the single law in Australia where it includes unfair terms and conditions in contract, a law where consumer brought goods and services consists of guarantee and warranties, consumer assistance & penalties, a new product law for safety and enforcing it (Consumerlaw, 2014). As inferred from the case study the negotiation was held between two parties i.e. Bronwyn who purchased Espresso Pty Ltd. and Tony the Chief Financial Officer of Espresso. These two parties have done the exchange by purchasing and sale of the cafe. In the negotiation process Tony has exchanged some E-Mails with Bronwyn where the representations are written about the profit of the last year financial year and an imagination of the future next three years. When investigation takes place it is revealed from historical accounts that the figures informed by Tony were grossly more than stated the future projections stated by him are all false in order to induce Bronwyn to purchase Espresso Pvt. Ltd cafe. Bronwyn has been operating the café from last six months and realized the information present on the E-Mails are fact less and false. She has discovered the series of documents which was found on the premises in a locked cabinet. According to Australian Consumer Law it is stated that a contract is broken when any of the two party breaches the contract without the consultation of other party (Coorey, 2011). This leads to misrepresentation of contract law in the above case mentioned as Tony has misrepresented the information to Bronwyn for purchasing the café. Misrepresentation is defined as the facts mentioned by one party to another party was falsely claimed in order to enter into a contract (Malbon and Nottage, 2013). The elements of misrepresentation are as follows:

                        </p>
                        <strong>
                        	Facts establish are untrue

                        </strong>
                        <p>
                        	The representation was made on dishonesty grounds and the facts mentioned was false an opinion given about the future predictions (Marston and Walsh, 2008). The facts were hidden form the other party in order to prevent the happenings. The person who has made the offer is hiding the information and the relationship trust and confidence is broken between them due to false representation of the contract made. The party who has made the offer has all the information regarding the purchasing and selling of the property but, is hiding so that the other party gets no information about it.

                        </p>
                        <strong>
                        	Inducing Other Party to form Contract

                        </strong>
                        <p>
                        	This representation is made by the influencing party to enter into contract with other party by making them induce by sayings that they are unaware about the information and the contract which will be forming will have no affects of formation (Badali et al., 2010). In this half truth is told to the other party while forming the contract. The other party who is innocent falsely is in the racket of the influential party by false claim which may cause monetary loss to other party.   

                        </p>
                        <strong>
                        	Parties in Contract

                        </strong>
                        <p>
                        	The parties who have entered into contract can be agents or the contract himself to purchase the property (Monahan, 2001). If the other party has done misrepresentation of information made by the other party is false then claims can be charged for this. 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                        	As inferred from the case study it can be said that it is a case of fraudulent misrepresentation by Tony of Espresso Pvt. Ltd. to Bronwyn as she got to know after operating six months that the E-Mails had all false information and the projection made for future for next three years were misrepresented. This was established by the locked cabinet which was present in the premises from a series of documents. The case of fraudulent misrepresentation is not easy to claim but due to the E-Mails sent to Bronwyn is a fact that the claim was false and fraud took place.  As per section 18 Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) it can be said that an individual who is making claims for the future and there are no reasons for citing the representations made then it is called misrepresentations. A person should not trade if he is misleading or engage in such activity which is misleading (Australiancontractlaw, 2014). The plaintiff in this case is Bronwyn and the defendant is Tony of Espresso Pvt. Ltd. and these parties are in contract which is leading to fraud and misrepresentation. 

                        </p>
                        <p>
                        	The remedies given to Bronwyn regarding the sale of property is that Tony should rescission all the materials which he has taken from her (Kozlina et al., 2003). He has to offer Bronwyn to return everything he has taken from while selling the café. The objection made by Bronwyn should be immediate upon knowing the facts that the information is misrepresented and should express her concern for cancellation of the contract. Bronwyn should not delay in notifying Tony the clams she has and she should have access to claims from Tony as the Chief Executive Officer of café. In case the plaintiff is asking for monetary loss than the total sum including the money paid for the sale of the café and the loss she made has to be paid by the defendant.

This notion was formulated so that the previous concept where unions use to indulge in strikes to oblige the referee where intervention and compromises were forced to choose their choice. 

                        </p>

                        	On completion of the course the skills gained by me has helped me in analyzing the problems which I faced as a student. Problem solving skill has helped me in achieving the goals in order to solve the problems effectively. In class I had issues regarding the law and rules given in the constitution so I asked my teachers to explain me for further clarification. While going through the process the first step is identifying the problem by spending some time in analyzing and communicating with others. Secondly, I use to structure the issue in a simple way to understand it quickly. Third step would be evaluating the actions and the solution for the problem by brainstorming with my friends and teachers. However, the teachers were supportive and provided relevant and elaborated materials on the case studies for understand the subject clearly and getting a better overview on the cases. The case studies that are explained by the teachers helped me in understanding laws and its amendments in respect to various issues. The session depends on solution taken for knowing the concept within the time constraints and case studies were taken place in the college to understand the concepts for more in depth knowledge where practical cases were solved in class.  There were seminars held in colleges where guest lecture used to share their knowledge about what kind of law amendments and original cases they have taken into account for making things more flexible while approaching them.  Attending the seminars helped me a lot in gaining proper understanding of the various law and laws and amendments in respect to the particular case and scenarios. The lecturers who are invited discussed various case studies and the laws that are implemented in those cases in reaching to the proper conclusion and in achieving the desired verdict.

                        	Several mind and understanding of several legal and ethical issues in respect to the management decisions develop and sometimes get changes into several dimensions. Though the acts, rules regulation are exact and obvious, but there are several interpretations of the rules and regulation of one single law in various issues and context. In the entire time span of the studying the  course, I analyzed that studying the legal and ethical issues an make one’s capabilities and management abilities even better. As studying various case studies, it becomes easier to analyze the situation and the issues it is dealing with. With advancement of the course and studying the case studies at the various levels dealing with several issues both legal and ethical, I observed that there are laws and rules for different clients and also for the different companies. I also observed that in some cases, the laws and rules sometimes similar to for the companies and the clients. But my understanding in this context is that I must always aware of my rights and values and have knowledge of the acts, rule and regulations and protocols. As a student I am studying several laws and rules and knowing about the laws and rules and right, and in future, while dealing with cases, professionally, I always must be stick to the rights and value and have proper awareness of the various policies, acts, rules and regulations.
