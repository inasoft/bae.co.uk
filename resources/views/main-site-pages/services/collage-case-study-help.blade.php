						<p>The students can create their case studies on both the conflicts of the discipline and in the details. By setting up an own <strong>case study, </strong> the student can also improve their creative thoughts and can gain some new insights. As a student, you can choose your case study depending on the basic rules of a good case and <strong>structure of the case study</strong>. The teachers of the college can suggest the students write a case study on few basic situations, issues and concepts. If the teacher tells the students how many characters do the students need to involve in the case study, it will be very helpful to the students. Your teacher can also advise you about the structure of the case study. The students can analyse the case studies individually or in a group. The may divide the students of a class into some groups for <strong>case study analysis</strong> and give different case studies to each group. On a keyboard, only one pair of hand can be fitted up, so it will be problematic to do the case studies without paper outside the class. If a student involves a case study, it can be a long-term activity. </p>
<p>Before writing the case study, the students have to identify the problem of the research. The class of the student or the college of the students does not matter so much.

You have to specify which information will more suitable for your case study, or you have to shorten your information After gathering all the information. During reducing the information, you have to focus on the topic of the case study. </p>
