							<div class="content"><h3>The magic of numbers – Mathematics as a subject</h3>
							Mathematics, the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangements is a very ancient field of study. Maths is the building block of everything in our everyday life; it is in everything we do. The history of maths goes back to as much as 5000 years ago. The beauty of mathematics makes every student appreciate and understand the discipline. In the dictionary language, Mathematics is the methodical treatment of measure, relationships between different forms and figures and the bond between the quantities that are expressed symbolically.
							<h4>Structure of Mathematics as a subject</h4>
							<p>The subject can be treated as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Human Endeavour: </strong>
									Measurement of time like hours, days, month, years and such is maths. The different system of distance measurement is maths. Mathematics is in art, dance and music as well. It is in almost every aspect of events used in the development of humans and human society.
								</li>
								<li><strong>Discipline: </strong>
									Maths is an organized and a formal field of study. It is defined by the type of problems, the method of resolving the problems and the results it achieves after solving the problem that it had addressed. It is a broad and deep discipline that keeps on growing.
								</li>
								<li><strong>Interconnected bridge between various other subjects:</strong>
									Learning has a prerequisite of writing and reading talents. Maths requires simple application of knowledge. Its utility can be judged by the fact that it is used as the elementary or basic study in our education system.
								</li>

							</ul>
							<h4>You need to crunch it, not mug it</h4>
							<p>
								Mathematics is an enigma, the more you understand it, the more you will want to know about it.

							<h3>The actions and reactions surrounding our life</h3>
							<p>
								Science is a word that brings different pictures in our minds ranging from a fat textbook to a lab coat, microscopes, telescopes, equations, laws and so on. These are all a fraction of science but not a complete picture of it. It is a collaborative human effort to understand better how everything in the world functions. It is a systematic endeavor that builds the knowledge in the form of explanations and predictions based on that knowledge regarding universe. 
							</p>
							<h4>The structural anatomy of science as a subject</h4>
							<p>
								Science is:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>A process:</strong>
									<p>
										Science is an ever-going process of study and discoveries. These new findings allow us to connect the isolated facts into the reasoned and detailed understanding of the natural world.
									</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Exciting:</strong>
									<p>
										The constant new discoveries and studies keep the student’s mind active and interested. One thing makes you eager to find the next and soon it turns into one big and exciting treasure-hunting game.
									</p>

								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Powerful:</strong>
									<p>
										The knowledge of science is reliable, useful and powerful. It can be used for creating new technology, find a treatment for diseases and find the solutions for other problems.
									</p>

								</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>
								A never-ending discovery - Science
							</h4>
							<p>
								Science is about continuously refining and expatiate our knowledge of universe. The more we surf, the more questions hit our mind and we move to find answers further. This is a never-ending and ever-going phenomenon. Science never ends. It gives you the power to create. Treat, explore and change the way people think. It gives you the power to control things and analyze the result of certain actions. Science is an ethereal magic.

							<h3>It’s all about the money and calculating it</h3>
							<p>Finance is all about managing, creating and studying the entire financial system that includes money, banking, investments, assets and liabilities. </p>
							<h3>Structural shape of Finance as a discipline</h3>
							Finance can be divided into three parts:
							
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Public finance:</strong> It is concerned with the total spendings and total earnings of the governmental agencies. It mostly includes study borrowings from banks, insurance companies and government. It also includes grants and aids, dividends and so on.</li>
								<li><strong>Corporate finance:</strong> Shares, debentures, shareholders, capital structure, firm valuation, anything to do with the companies and corporate comes under corporate financing. Every decision that a firm does regarding its finances is covered under the heading.</li>
								<li><strong>Personal finance:</strong> Individuals earn and spend. The study of it is called personal finance. It is the financial management of an individual and a family unit, their budget, savings, spending and monetary resources over time.</li>
							</ul>
							All these three categories are anxious with activities like following sound investments, obtaining low- cost credit, allocating funds for liabilities, and banking. Yet each of category has its own definite deliberations. We can explain these categories with examples also individuals require provision for retirement expenses. Other categories are also helpful for future purposes.

							<h4>One of the most emerging fields of study - Finance</h4>
							<p>
								In simpler terms, Finance is all about the exchange of existing resources. It requires detailing and analysis. It is a vast and recurring process. It keeps going on and on. Set goals, plan and keep tracking. These are the three key points of successful financing. But before doing anything you need to make yourself familiar with the terms and process of financing. Any activity without the knowledge of the subject is a waste. Finance is beautiful; it teaches you how to do well even in small earnings and save well. Not just save well but if you save with brains, you might even become rich.

                                                            The study of computers and the entire system is called computer science. Its study mostly deals in software and software system, their theory, design, development and application.  It is a discipline that spans theory and practices.
							<h4>Why only computer science and nothing else?</h4>
                                                        Here are some reasons why you should study computer science:
							<ul>
								<li>This is a digital age and this age needs computer scientists. They theorize, design, develop and apply the programs-both hardware and software that we use in everyday life. Well, this does sound very important.</li>
								<li>Students of computer science have excellent prospects as graduates. This is a field that gives high employment opportunities, both in India and abroad.</li>
								<li>Research has proved that computer science student earn well in life and have more scope of moving up the corporate ladder quickly as compared to other discipline. </li>
								<li>Every industry uses computer in the age of digitization hence it is implied that they require computer science degree holders to keep their systems run efficiently and effectively, without errors. </li>
								<li>The scope of computer science includes internationally diverse cohort, which means you will get the exposure to diverse Indian and international cultures. It will also help in creating all kinds of contacts that will prove beneficial in the future.</li>
								
							</ul>
                                                        <h4>Will there ever be an era without computers again?</h4>
                                                        We guess these are the enough reasons for studying the subject. Computers are global and will give you a global opportunity of working.

								</li>

								<li>
									<strong>
										Planning:
									</strong>

								</li>

								<li>
									<strong>
										Monitoring and controlling:
									</strong>
									
									Project managers will contrast development and current status of the original project and add resources to execute the remaining job. This part involves project managers rescheduling in the scheme of things or do what is crucial to prevent the project to go in muck.
