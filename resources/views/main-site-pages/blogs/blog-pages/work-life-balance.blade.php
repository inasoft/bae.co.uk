						<h3>Work-Life Balance</h3>
						<p>Today, most of the employees face a challenge of finding balance in between work and daily life. It is because; their work affects their families and personal life. Concerning this challenge, it becomes essential for employees to find a balance in between their professional and personal life. With an increasing demand of balance among employees work and personal life, the concept of work-life balance is introduced. It is a concept supporting the efforts of employees to divide their time and energy between work and other significant aspects of their lives. </p>

						<p>
							It is an everyday effort to make time for family, friends, community, spirituality, personal growth, self-care, and different personal activities along with the regular work demands. Employers play an important role in this regard as they are the one who form effective policies, processes, actions, and prospects empowering employees to easily follow balanced lives. Efforts made by employers in this regard help employees to reduce the stress they experience, and direct them towards becoming more productive and satisfied. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Employers can help their employees in attaining an effective balance in between the demands of their job and the healthy management of their personal needs and lives, by implementing different work-life balance initiatives. Some of the benefits used by organisations nowadays are flexible working arrangements, on-site child care, seasonal childcare programs, parental leave, and family leave policies, employee assistance programs, internal and external training opportunities etc. To effectively implement such kind of initiatives and programs, it is vital for employers to consider factors like different generation working, culture, age, personal needs, and socioeconomic status.
